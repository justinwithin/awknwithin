## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| **Git** | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Mac has it built in) |
| **Node.js** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **Claude Code** | [docs.anthropic.com/claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) |
| **GitHub account** | [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) (free) |

Quick check — paste into your terminal:
```bash
git --version && node --version && claude --version
```
All three should print version numbers.

## Quick start

**1. Clone this repo** — replace `my-project` with your project name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsonnad/alpacapps-infra.git my-project
cd my-project
```

**2. Open Claude Code** — you must be inside the project folder:
```bash
claude
```

**3. Run the setup wizard:**
```
/setup-alpacapps-infra
```

That's it. Claude creates your own GitHub repo, disconnects from this template, walks you through setting up each service, and pushes everything live.

> **⚠️ "Skill not found"?** You're not inside the cloned folder. The skill lives at `.claude/skills/` inside the project. Run `pwd` to check, then `cd my-project` if needed.

## What happens during setup

The setup wizard will:
1. Ask what you're building and which services you need
2. Create a new GitHub repo under your account
3. Disconnect from the `alpacapps-infra` template origin
4. Customize the codebase for your organization (branding, basePath, i18n)
5. Set up Supabase (create org + project), deploy edge functions, configure webhooks
6. Scaffold login/auth system and admin CRUD pages for your entities
7. Build your `CLAUDE.md` with all credentials and connection details
8. Push everything to your new repo — your site goes live on GitHub Pages

## After setup

Every new Claude Code session automatically reads your `CLAUDE.md` and knows your entire stack — database schema, API keys, deployment flow, everything. Just tell Claude what to build.

## Customization

See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for a detailed guide on what gets customized for each new organization and how to modify the template.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (static export)
- **i18n:** Dictionary-based multi-language support (English, Spanish, French by default)
