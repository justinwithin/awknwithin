          <p>Ketamine is a medication known for its fast-acting effects on depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction. It was first used as an anesthetic but has been found to help with mental health due to its unique effects on the brain. Ketamine works by blocking NMDA receptors, which increase brain activity and help form new connections. This process can quickly reduce symptoms of mental health issues.</p>
          <p>Ketamine-assisted therapy (KAT) combines ketamine with therapy sessions. During a session, a patient takes ketamine under medical supervision. The medication helps patients feel less defensive, allowing them to explore difficult emotions and memories safely. This can lead to significant breakthroughs in understanding and managing their mental health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tabs__panel">
          <p>We begin with a discovery call to discuss your needs and symptoms and determine if ketamine-assisted therapy might benefit you. If it seems suitable, you'll meet with our medical team for an initial consultation and psychiatric assessment.</p>
          <p>A typical KAT session lasts about two hours. Before the ketamine is administered, you'll meet with your guide to prepare, ground yourself, and discuss your intentions. During the session, your guide will be present through your entire experience, providing knowledgeable guidance and support.</p>
          <p>After the session, there's often much to process. You'll have follow-up sessions with your guide and a licensed therapist to understand and apply these insights to your daily life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tabs__panel">
          <p>Ketamine therapy is often recommended for those with depression, anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain, or addiction that hasn't improved with other treatments. It can be especially helpful for those who haven't found relief with traditional methods. However, it might not be suitable for people with a history of psychosis, schizophrenia, high blood pressure, or severe liver conditions. A thorough evaluation with a health professional will help determine if this therapy is right for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tabs__panel">
          <p>Psychedelic integration is a vital part of the process. It means understanding and applying the lessons from your ketamine experience to daily life. The integration process looks different for everyone but always aims to make sense of the psychedelic experience and apply the insights gained. This process helps you find balance and wholeness in mind, body, spirit, lifestyle, and relationships.</p>
